# Favourite-Movie-Application
 The Favorite Movies App is a simple web application for managing your personal movie collection. Users can add movies with a title, image URL, and rating, view the list of added movies, and delete movies with a confirmation prompt. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app dynamically updates the UI based on the movies in the list.
